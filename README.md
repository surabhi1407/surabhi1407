### About me
I design and build **data platforms** that turn raw information into something the business can actually use - reliable data that drives insights and better decisions.  

My work sits at the intersection of:
- **Data engineering** â†’ scalable pipelines, cost-efficient queries, and clear observability  
- **Platform design** â†’ dbt + Airflow/Composer patterns that teams can trust and reuse  
- **AI empowerment** â†’ helping people in any domain see how AI can simplify their work, spark new ideas, and extend their expertise  

I believe technology should **remove friction, not add it**. Whether itâ€™s data systems or AI tools, my goal is always the same: make them simple, practical, and useful so people can focus on what matters most.
